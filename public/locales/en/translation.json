  "aboutText1": "GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools.",
  "aboutTitle2": "Describe what’s possible <br/> with a type system",
  "aboutText2": "GraphQL APIs are organized in terms of types and fields, not endpoints. Access the full capabilities of your data from a single endpoint. GraphQL uses types to ensure Apps only ask for what’s possible and provide clear and helpful errors. Apps can use types to avoid writing manual parsing code.",
  "aboutTitle3": "Move faster with powerful <br/> developer tools",
  "aboutText3": "Know exactly what data you can request from your API without leaving your editor, highlight potential issues before sending a query, and take advantage of improved code intelligence. QraphiQL makes it easy to build powerful tools like QraphiQL by leveraging your API’s type system.",
